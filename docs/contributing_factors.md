# Contributing Factor Development for Identifying Disruptive Innovation in the IT Industry

In constructing the theoretical framework for identifying early indicators of disruptive innovation within the IT industry, the analysis meticulously considered a range of critiques and expansions upon Christensen's seminal theory of disruptive
innovation. The evaluation also incorporated various frameworks and methodologies geared towards the early detection of such innovations. The outcome of this scrutiny is the development of twenty-nine theoretical propositions crafted to accurately
identify disruptive innovations before their pronounced impact on the IT sector. The formulation of these propositions was enriched by insights drawn from numerous seminal studies, including significant contributions by:

- Rafii et al. (2002)
- Tellis (2006)
- Govindarajan and Kopalle (2006)
- Christensen et al. (2005, 2015)
- Klenner et al. (2013, 2009)
- Hüsig and Hipp (2005)
- Paap et al. (2004)
- Guo et al. (2019)
- Ganzarain et al. (2021)

These studies provide valuable perspectives and evaluative criteria based on Christensen’s theory, collectively augmenting the predictive capability of the proposed methodology. This in-depth literature review serves as a cornerstone in establishing
key factors that influence the IT sector, bolstering the robustness and applicability of the developed framework.

## Shaping the Propositions

The framework leverages the comprehensive definition of disruptive innovation, encompassing concepts of low-end disruption, high-end disruption, and the creation of entirely new markets. Disruptive innovation can manifest in various forms:

    Low-End Disruption: Innovations that are more affordable and simpler than existing options, targeting customers who are underserved by current market offerings.
    High-End Disruption: Innovations that are pricier and more sophisticated, appealing to customers who demand higher performance or advanced features.
    Creation of New Markets: Innovations that generate entirely new demand and market segments by offering products or services that were previously unavailable or unimagined.

These varied manifestations highlight the diverse nature of disruptive innovations and their potential to reshape industries by meeting different customer needs and preferences.


## Key Theoretical Propositions

1. **Elevated Switching Costs:**
   - High costs associated with transitioning to new products or services.
   - Consideration of financial outlays related to training and infrastructure changes, as well as expenses for updating platforms (Gröhn, 1999; Varian & Farrell, 2005).

2. **Reduced Willingness to Pay for Quality Enhancement:**
   - Customers show limited interest in paying extra for further quality improvements in products and services (Christensen, 1997; Klenner et al., 2013).

3. **Prolonged Market Dominance:**
   - Firms that have controlled a significant portion of the market for an extended time may become complacent, focusing on sustaining innovations and potentially overlooking disruptive changes (Strebel, 1987; Klepper, 1997).

4. **Static Market Scenario Induced by Incumbents:**
   - Incumbents with substantial market share often lead to a more static market environment, characterized by limited dynamism and innovation (Strebel, 1987; Klepper, 1997).

5. **High Number of New Market Entrants:**
   - A surge of new firms typically indicates a higher likelihood of disruptive innovation occurring (Gort & Klepper, 1982; Agarwal & Gort, 1996).

6. **Shift of Market Shares Toward Low-End or High-End Offerings:**
   - Market share shifts towards low-end or high-end offerings suggest distinct alternatives rather than mere refinements, indicating potential disruption (Schmidt, 2008; Klenner et al., 2013).

7. **Enhancements in the Value Chain:**
   - Changes in products or technologies at different stages of the value chain can heighten the likelihood of disruption (Tripsas, 2008; Klenner et al., 2013).

8. **High Market Entry Barriers:**
   - Strong intellectual property rights, licensing requirements, and other barriers can foster unique approaches for successful market entry (Geroski, 1999; Klenner et al., 2009).

9. **Customer Loyalty:**
   - High customer loyalty can act as a significant barrier to the entry and success of disruptive products (Adner & Levinthal, 2002; Rafii & Kampas, 2002).

10. **Increasing Market Prices and Demand for Low-End Offers:**
    - Rising prices and declining sales figures indicate a market ripe for low-end disruption (Klenner et al., 2013).

11. **Radical Sustaining Innovation:**
    - Intense focus on improving existing products may lead to neglect of emerging disruptive trends (Klenner et al., 2013).

12. **Simpler, More Convenient, Affordable, Reliable Products:**
    - Disruptive innovations often offer simpler, more affordable, and reliable alternatives compared to existing market options (Christensen, 1997; Sainio, 2004).

13. **Different Business Structure:**
    - A distinct business structure can be a strong indicator of potential market disruption (Bower & Christensen, 1995; Habtay & Holmén, 2014).

14. **High Initial Capital Requirements:**
    - The need for substantial initial investment can deter many potential entrants, leaving an opening for disruptors (Rafii & Kampas, 2002).

15. **Existence of Low-End Offers:**
    - The presence of low-end offerings in the market becomes increasingly important as customers seek alternatives to higher-priced existing products (Klenner et al., 2013).

16. **Cloud Computing and On-Demand Services:**
    - Cloud computing offers scalable and flexible IT solutions, challenging traditional IT service models (Marston et al., 2011).

17. **Financial Technology Advances:**
    - Innovations in fintech are reshaping business models and consumer interactions in the IT industry (Arner et al., 2015).

18. **Public Perception and Brand Reputation:**
    - Innovations that significantly improve or alter public perception can disrupt market standings (Fombrun & Shanley, 1990).

19. **Cross-Industry Innovation:**
    - Innovations that cross industry boundaries can create unique value propositions and disrupt multiple sectors simultaneously (Enkel & Gassmann, 2010).

20. **Shifts in Workforce Dynamics:**
    - Changes in workforce dynamics, including remote work and the gig economy, influence business models and indicate disruptive potential (Boudreau & Ziskin, 2011).

21. **Consumer Empowerment and Participation:**
    - Participatory business models drive innovation, indicating a shift in how companies interact with and learn from consumers (Prahalad & Ramaswamy, 2004a).

22. **Adaptability and Agile Development:**
    - The ability to adapt quickly to market changes using agile methodologies can be a key factor in identifying potential disruptors (Rigby et al., 2016).

23. **Platform-Based Business Models:**
    - Platform models facilitate interactions between user groups, challenging traditional linear business models (Cusumano et al., 2019).

24. **Regulatory Changes and Compliance:**
    - Innovations that offer compliance solutions or capitalize on regulatory shifts can be particularly disruptive (Parker & Van Alstyne, 2018).

25. **Globalization and Cross-Border Collaboration:**
    - The globalization of markets fosters innovative ecosystems, allowing rapid spread of disruptive technologies (Ghemawat, 2001).

26. **Environmental Sustainability:**
    - Innovations that reduce environmental impact can disrupt markets increasingly focused on green technology (Bocken et al., 2014).

27. **Cybersecurity Concerns:**
    - Evolving cybersecurity threats drive innovation, particularly in IT sectors dealing with sensitive data (Kshetri, 2013).

28. **Data-Driven Decision Making:**
    - Increasing reliance on big data and analytics can significantly influence market disruption (Provost & Fawcett, 2013).

29. **Integration with Emerging Technologies:**
    - Integration or convergence with emerging technologies like AI, IoT, and blockchain can be critical factors in market disruption (Anderson & Tushman, 1990).
